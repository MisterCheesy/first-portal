- An OD dose of Transblossom causes a lot of rapid shifts, dehydration.  Pain causes lack of focus which causes all the shifts.
- Green Kale-like leaves with red stripes. Red spiky flowers
- Leaves give "safer" properties.
- Flowers are auto OD.
- Processing makes it last longer, more predictable.
- Moderately Addictive.  When in withdrawal start to melt/lose control of form.
- OD is form starts shifting wildly based on any surface thoughts.   Lots of pain, can die.

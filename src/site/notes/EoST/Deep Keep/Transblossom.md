- An OD dose of Transblossom causes a lot of rapid shifts, dehydration.  Pain causes lack of focus which causes all the shifts.
- Green Kale-like leaves with red stripes. Red spiky flowers
- Leaves give "safer" properties.
- Flowers are auto OD.
- Processing makes it last longer, more predictable.
- Addictive, makes you sick, on withdrawal start to melt/lose control of form.  Takes many doses.
